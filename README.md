# 🧠 AI Portfolio — Applied & Research Projects

This repository is a **living portfolio** of my work in **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Edge AI**.
It consolidates my **practice projects, research experiments, and production-oriented prototypes** into a single, well-structured codebase.

The goal of this repository is threefold:

1. **Demonstrate depth** in modern AI techniques through hands-on implementation
2. **Document learning** with reproducible experiments and clean code
3. **Showcase applied + research-oriented thinking** suitable for real-world deployment

## 👨‍🎓 About Me

I hold a **Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering (Computer Engineering major)** and am currently pursuing a **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence**.
My primary interests lie at the intersection of:

* **Edge AI & TinyML**
* **Computer Vision**
* **Robotics & Embodied AI**
* **Generative AI & Agentic Systems**
* **Model Compression (Quantization, KD, Pruning)**
* **Quantum Machine Learning (research-focused)**

This repository reflects both **industry-relevant engineering** and **academic research rigor**.
