# 🤖 Agentic AI

This directory contains my work on **Agentic AI systems**—AI systems that **plan, reason, act, and adapt** by interacting with tools, environments, and other agents rather than producing single-shot outputs.

The focus is on building **robust, modular, and production-oriented agents** that go beyond prompt engineering and demonstrate **autonomy, persistence, and decision-making**.

## 🎯 Scope & Motivation

Modern AI applications increasingly require models that can:

* Decompose complex tasks
* Maintain internal state and memory
* Use external tools and APIs
* Coordinate with other agents
* Operate reliably over long horizons

This folder explores how to design such systems in a **principled and scalable way**.

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

* **Planning & Reasoning**

  * Task decomposition
  * ReAct-style reasoning loops
  * Multi-step decision making

* **Tool Use**

  * API calling
  * Code execution
  * Retrieval and search
  * Environment interaction

* **Memory**

  * Short-term (contextual) memory
  * Long-term memory (vector stores, logs)
  * State persistence across runs

* **Control & Safety**

  * Guardrails and constraints
  * Failure detection and recovery
  * Cost and latency control
