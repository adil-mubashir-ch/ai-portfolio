Here’s a **clear, forward-looking README** for an **`agentic-ai/`** folder that fits your portfolio style and signals *production + research maturity*.
It’s written so both **engineers** and **research-minded reviewers** immediately understand what you’re building and *why*.

You can save this as:

# 🤖 Agentic AI

This directory contains my work on **Agentic AI systems**—AI systems that **plan, reason, act, and adapt** by interacting with tools, environments, and other agents rather than producing single-shot outputs.

The focus is on building **robust, modular, and production-oriented agents** that go beyond prompt engineering and demonstrate **autonomy, persistence, and decision-making**.

---

## 🎯 Scope & Motivation

Modern AI applications increasingly require models that can:

* Decompose complex tasks
* Maintain internal state and memory
* Use external tools and APIs
* Coordinate with other agents
* Operate reliably over long horizons

This folder explores how to design such systems in a **principled and scalable way**.
